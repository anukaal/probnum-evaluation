==================
ProbNum-Evaluation
==================


**Evaluate the performance of (probabilistic) numerical methods.**
What makes an efficient and well calibrated probabilistic numerical algorithm?
We don't know either, but at least we can offer some quantification.

ProbNum-Evaluation offers a range of evaluation measures, including error analyses (with respect to different norms),
calibration measures (chi-square statistics, non-credibility indices) and more.

To learn how to use ProbNum-Evaluation check out the `quickstart guide <introduction/quickstart.html>`_ and the tutorials.
