==================
ProbNum-Evaluation
==================



**Evaluate the performance of (probabilistic) numerical methods.**
What makes an efficient and well calibrated probabilistic numerical algorithm?
We don't know either, but at least we can offer some quantification.


ProbNum-Evaluation offers a range of evaluation measures, including error analyses (with respect to different norms),
calibration measures (chi-square statistics, non-credibility indices) and more.
